# JWE Test Suite

JAMflow is actively developing JWE support for Nitro and H3. This repository provides a simple Go-based command-line tool to verify and test the compatibility of JWE tokens generated by H3 with other libraries. It allows for quick validation and ensures interoperability across different JWE implementations.
